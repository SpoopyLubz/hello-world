# hello-world

oh, hello.
there's not much I can say about myself really, 
some would say i'm sad and not very cheery,
but I would like to contradict that theory,
and say I find joy in what may be quite eerie.

I'm what you may call your 'stereotypical teenager',
I'm lonely, have acne, and occasionally stuck one a one pager,
but im quite odd compared to others,
I dont care about looks, or grades, or lovers,
what peaks my interests is amazing,
quite the grotesque, and somehow fazing.

The shreiks, the screams, and all the cries of terror,
The utterly horrified faces after they've realized their error,
have me infatuated as an inhumane eyeglass wearer.
But do not be wary,
I'm just but a very, very, very,very,
peculiar literary
who has far bigger dreams 
than her little heart can carry.
The culmination is awaiting,
at the end of my conversating
with the unsettling,
deafening,
silence that is beckoning
for commotion
to rid of this unspoken
erosion
that you are heeding,
feeding, by not contributing to my ongoing rapture
but you see,
you don't know me,
so what you foresee to be seemingly knowing me
is quite suddenly
sullenly
ceasing to be poetry.
